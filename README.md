# Ticket-Booking-System-Api-with-Role-Base-Auth
Project: Ticket Booking System API with Role-Based Authentication

Description:
Developed a secure and scalable Ticket Booking System API using Spring Boot with role-based authentication to manage ticket reservations for various events. The API allowed users with different roles (e.g., admin, user) to perform different actions based on their permissions.

Technologies Used:
- Spring Boot
- Java
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- MySQL (or your preferred database)

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints to manage ticket reservations, event details, and user roles.
- Utilized Spring Security to enforce role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users could perform specific actions.
- Implemented token-based authentication using JWT to enhance security and manage user sessions effectively.
- Designed the database schema for MySQL, storing event information, user details, and role permissions.
- Implemented data validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and improve the API's robustness.
- Conducted thorough testing to validate the API's functionality and security, including unit tests and integration testing.
- Documented the API endpoints and role-based permissions to assist developers and stakeholders in integrating and understanding the functionality.
- Utilized version control ( Git) to track code changes and enable collaboration with the development team.

Results:
- Successfully delivered a fully functional Ticket Booking System API with role-based authentication, providing a seamless and secure ticket reservation experience.
- Enhanced the user experience by implementing role-based access, ensuring that users only had access to relevant functionalities.
- Improved system security, preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches through JWT-based authentication.
- Received positive feedback from the development team and project stakeholders for meeting project objectives and delivering high-quality code.
